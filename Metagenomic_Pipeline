#Metagenomics pipeline
#Initiated: October 30, 2019 by Rachael Storo
#Last Edit: October 30, 2019 by Rachael Storo
#Purpose: Create a script for the processing of environmental metagenomic samples
#Disclaimer: No pipeline or script should be followed blindly. Ensure that this script and the programs used make sense for the samples you have.
#You may or may not utilize all steps of this pipeline- that depends entirely on your question. Understanding the pipeline and your question will save you time by not running steps you don't need.


#Step One- Demultiplex
# Not all data will require this step- in fact, many metagenomes are sequenced individually or are given to you already demultiplexed.


#Step Two- Quality trimming and filtering

#Step Three A- No Assembly

#Step Three B- Assembly

#Step Four A- Gene Calling and Taxonomic Profiling

#Step Four B- Mapping

#Step Five- Recovering Metagenome Assembled Genomes

#Step Six- Phylogenomics

#Step Seven- Comparative Genomics

#Step Eight- Pangenomics
